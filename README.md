# AirWatch

To execute the program, compile it using `make`. Then launch it using the generated .exe file (`./AirWatch.exe`).
In order to see the execution times of each algorithm, compile using `make debug` to add the DEBUG flag.

Execute tests by going in the Tests/ directory and compiling the tests using `make`. 
You can then execute unit tests by launching `./UnitTests.exe`, and integration tests by launching `./IntegrationTests.exe`. 
**Note: ** the program has to be compiled without the DEBUG flag, otherwise the tests won't work.
